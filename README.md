# Useful-Academic-Links

#### This repo has some usefull links to websites for topics, please fork, add and generate a pull-request to join the party:tada::smirk:
#### Show your :heart: for spreading knowledge :sunglasses: :metal:

#### Tips
Once you visit the link, to venture into more links related to that subject/instructor/university play around with the link ,i.e change the link hierarchy 

***eg: http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~martha/courses/4130/au13/ to http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~martha/courses/*** 
to see other courses of the faculty.

## Instructions to add links
1. Please maintain the heirarchy
2. Incase you think you have to add a new category please do so in respective heirarchy
3. You may add a line or two for links discription.
4. If you feel a course link is outdated please ~~CUT IT DOWN~~ **don't remove it**.
